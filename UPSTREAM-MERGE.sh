# This script takes as arguments:
# $1 - [REQUIRED] upstream version as the first argument to merge
# $2 - [optional] branch to update, defaults to master. could be a versioned release branch, e.g., release-3.10
# $3 - [optional] non-openshift remote to pull code from, defaults to upstream
#
# Note: this script is only maintained in the master branch. Other branches
# should copy this script into that branch in case newer changes have been
# made. Something like this will get the file from the master branch without
# staging it: git show master:UPSTREAM-MERGE.sh > UPSTREAM-MERGE.sh
#
# Warning: this script resolves all conflicts by overwritting the conflict with
# the upstream version. If a SDK specific patch was made downstream that is
# not in the incoming upstream code, the changes will be lost.
#
# Origin remote is assumed to point to openshift/ocp-release-operator-sdk
