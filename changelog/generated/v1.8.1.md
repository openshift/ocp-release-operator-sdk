## v1.8.1

### Bug Fixes

- For Helm-based operators, empty patch requests generated from the 3-way merge are filtered to avoid unnecessary requests to the kube apiserver. ([#4971](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/4971))
- Fixed the `operator-sdk generate bundle` command to specify the right path of bundle metadata in bundle.Dcokerfile. ([#5037](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/5037))
- For Helm-based operators, fixed release equality comparison such that number values are compared and not their types to avoid unnecessary reconciliations. ([#5045](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/5045))
